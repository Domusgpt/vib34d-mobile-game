# 🎮 Lattice Pulse - VIB34D Mobile Game

**Beat-driven lattice runner built on the VIB34D visualizer stack**

A mobile web game that transforms 4D geometric visualizations into an interactive rhythm-based experience.

## 🚀 Play Now

**Live Game:** https://domusgpt.github.io/vib34d-mobile-game

Simply open the URL on your mobile device or desktop browser to start playing.

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Tap and Hold** to create pulse waves
2. **Capture geometric targets** as they appear in the lattice
3. **Build combos** by hitting multiple targets in sequence
4. **Survive** by maintaining your shield energy
5. **Progress** through increasingly complex geometric patterns

## 🎨 Game Features

- **4 Visual Systems**: FACETED, QUANTUM, HOLOGRAPHIC, and POLYCHORA modes
- **Dynamic Geometry**: 8 different geometric forms that evolve with your progress
- **Audio-Reactive**: Responds to music and generates beats
- **Progressive Levels**: Difficulty scales with geometric complexity
- **Mobile Optimized**: Touch controls and responsive design
- **PWA Ready**: Install as an app on your device

## 🎮 Controls

- **Tap & Hold**: Create expanding pulse waves to capture targets
- **Long Press**: Activate slow-motion "Phase Drift" mode
- **Button Controls**:
  - Switch Mode (changes visual system)
  - Shift Geometry (cycles through geometric forms)
  - Next Level (advance to harder patterns)

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **WebGL Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated 4D mathematics
- **ES6 Modules**: Clean, modular JavaScript architecture
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable with offline support
- **Mobile-First**: Touch interactions and responsive layout
- **Audio Processing**: Real-time frequency analysis

## 📱 Installation

### As a Web App (PWA)
1. Open the game URL in your mobile browser
2. Tap "Add to Home Screen" when prompted
3. Launch from your device's home screen

### For Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Domusgpt/vib34d-mobile-game.git
cd vib34d-mobile-game

# Start local server
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

## 🎵 Game Modes

### 🔷 FACETED Mode
Simple 2D geometric patterns - perfect for learning the game mechanics.

### 🌌 QUANTUM Mode
Complex 3D lattice effects with particle-like behaviors.

### ✨ HOLOGRAPHIC Mode
Audio-reactive visualizations that pulse and respond to sound.

### 🔮 POLYCHORA Mode
True 4D polytope mathematics - the ultimate challenge.

## 📊 Scoring System

- **Base Points**: 120 + (target age × 40)
- **Combo Multiplier**: 1 + (combo × 0.1)
- **Perfect Hits**: Bonus points for orb-type targets
- **Shield System**: Lose energy for missed targets

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

1. **Build Combos**: Chain hits together for massive score multipliers
2. **Use Phase Drift**: Long press to slow time during difficult sections
3. **Learn Patterns**: Each geometry type has unique spawn behaviors
4. **Audio Sync**: Listen to the rhythm for optimal timing
5. **Shield Management**: Balance aggressive play with survival
